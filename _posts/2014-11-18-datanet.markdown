description: DataNet enables lightweight metadata and data management in applications exploiting high-performance computing (HPC) resources. It allows to create ad-hoc data models and deploy them as actionable repositories with easy access restriction configuration and accessibility which is programming language neutral by using REST-like approach for data recording and retrieval. DataNet data models comprise structured data which is typical for SQL database storage scenarios, as well as, files which are well-suited for storing unstructured data. DataNet ensures scalability by using one of the available PaaS platforms combined with storage sites provided by HPC to implement the storage backend.
