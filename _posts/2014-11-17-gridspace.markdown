description: GridSpace is a novel virtual laboratory framework enabling researchers to conduct virtual experiments on Grid-based resources and other HPC infrastructures. It facilitates exploratory development of experiments by means of scripts which can be expressed in a number of popular languages, including Ruby, Python and Perl. The framework comes with a repository of gems which enable scripts to interface low-level resources such as PBS queues, EGEE computing elements, LFC directories etc. Moreover, GridSpace provides a Web 2.0-based Experiment Workbench supporting joint development and execution of virtual experiments by groups of collaborating scientists.
