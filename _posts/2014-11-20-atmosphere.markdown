description: The Atmosphere platform is responsible for maintaining an interface between the end-user tools and the underlying hardware resources required to perform complex computations in a distributed cloud environment. The Atmosphere approach is not to develop low-level cloud middleware or services, but rather to build on top of existing solutions â€“ thus Atmosphere integrates resources acquired from commercial IaaS providers (e.g. Amazon EC2) with privately-deployed open-source cloud platforms (e.g. OpenStack). The result is a hybrid Cloud infrastructure on which users can expose and access domain-oriented computational and data storage services representing various areas of science.
