description: The rimrock_logo.pngRimrock application simplifies the way how you can interact with the remote servers. It allows to execute application in a batch mode or start an interactive application, where  application output can be fetched online and new input can be sent using a simple REST interface. What is more, by using a dedicated REST interface you will be able to start a new job in the infrastructure. You don't need to care about the way how to create a correct job description using JDL (Job Description Language) â€“ just pass the command you want to execute and we will do the rest.
